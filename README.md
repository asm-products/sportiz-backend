# Here's what's done so far:
+ nodeJS / mongooose / passport / mongoDB initial setup is done.
+ user (account) and event entities have been created.
+ user authentication is done. The APIs are:
    + POST /api/v1/auth/login
    + POST /api/v1/auth/register
    + GET /api/v1/auth/logout
+ events - basic APIs are done for creation and read all:
    + POST /api/v1/events
    + GET /api/v1/events
+ tests: basic positive tests have been done with mocha and superagent

# Getting this running:
+ Install nodejs / npm
+ Do an npm install from the command line to install all the packages in package.json
+ Run mongodb locally (I usually run it as mongod --dbpath db)
+ Run node app.js from the server directory to start the server
+ Run npm test from another window to run all the tests
+ Hit the http://localhost:3000/api/v1/events API in your browser to see basic events

# Whats left to be done:
+ Authorization for the routes
+ Routes for read one, update and delete for events
+ Routes for user management? (delete user, update user)
+ Negative tests 
+ Add validation to event and user model

# What I need:
+ More detail on the event model and user model
+ Any thoughts on the APIs
+ Thoughts on authorization
